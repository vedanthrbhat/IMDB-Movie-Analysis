# IMDB Movies Analytics

This project aims to analyze IMDB movie data to understand what factors influence a movie's success based on IMDB ratings.

## Tech Stack

**Tool:** Excel

## About

The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate is: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Success is defined by high IMDB ratings. Understanding these factors is crucial for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to make informed decisions for future projects.

## Description

The project involves the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types, and feature engineering.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different variables such as genre, director, budget, and movie ratings.
- **Five 'Whys' Approach**: Using the root cause analysis method to understand why certain factors influence IMDB ratings.
- **Report & Data Storytelling**: Presenting findings through visualizations and insights to support decision-making.

## Data Analytics Tasks

### A) Movie Genre Analysis

**Task:** Analyze the distribution of movie genres and their impact on the IMDB score.
- Determine the most common genres of movies in the dataset.
- Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of the IMDB scores for each genre.

**Hint:** Use Excel's COUNTIF function to count movies by genre. Utilize AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE, MAX, MIN, VAR, and STDEV functions for statistical analysis.

### B) Movie Duration Analysis

**Task:** Analyze the distribution of movie durations and identify its relationship with IMDB scores.
- Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for movie durations.
- Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between movie duration and IMDB scores.
- Add a trendline to assess the relationship.

### C) Language Analysis

**Task:** Examine the distribution of movies based on their language and analyze their impact on IMDB ratings.
- Identify the most common languages used in movies.
- Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of IMDB scores for each language.

**Hint:** Use Excel's COUNTIF function to count movies by language and statistical functions for descriptive analysis.

### D) Director Analysis

**Task:** Analyze the influence of directors on movie ratings.
- Identify the top directors based on their average IMDB score.
- Use percentile calculations to assess their contribution to movie success.

**Hint:** Calculate the average IMDB score for each director. Use Excel's PERCENTILE function to compare director scores to the overall distribution.

### E) Budget Analysis

**Task:** Explore the relationship between movie budgets and their financial success.
- Analyze the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings.
- Identify movies with the highest profit margins.

**Hint:** Use Excel's CORREL function to calculate the correlation coefficient between budgets and gross earnings. Determine profit margins using (gross earnings - budget) and find the highest using Excel's MAX function.
